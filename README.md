# MyHolo - raise your own Holo

An application that allows you to raise your own virtual Holo. Users are able to feed it, play with it, and interact with it. Being a good Holo owner will be rewarded with coins, while bad one's will experience the lost of their Holo forever! This application will be powered with React on the front-end and renders ThreeJS Library with React-Three-Fiber.

## Thoughts Before Creation / User-Planning: </br>

</br>

( As a user, I want **\_\_\_** so, as a developer, I should **\_\_\_**)

- As a user I want to be able to see these amazing 3D features. As a developer; I will accomplish this by using ThreeJS and React-Three-Fiber to render 3D models and UI's</br>
  </br>

- As a user I want to be able to see my Holo and name it. As a developer, I will choose a model that will be rendered when components are mounted and then implement a form that will store user inputs into state when submitted.</br>
  </br>

- As a user I want to be able to at least interact with my Holo in two different ways; I as a developer, will have eventlisteners that will allow users to feed and play with their Holo</br>
  </br>

- As a user with a low end computer, I would still like to run this application. As a developer, I will try to accomplish this by choosing models that are not too heavy on textures and use as little z-axis lighting as possible.</br>
  </br>

- As a user I want to push the boundaries and see what it will take for me to lose my Holo. As a developer, I will implement a feature that will decrement Holo's health based on boredom and hunger, and [ allow users to own a new Holo with an X amount of currency ( stretch ) ].</br>
